# The Spark Ethos

## Regardless of how Spark engages on a given research or insight requirement, our end goal is always the same:

## To deliver clear, business-relevant recommendations that support your business objectives, based on observable consumer or customer behaviours, expectations or wants.

## Achieving this requires a specific way of working.  It is not rocket science, but neither is it the 'standard' experience clients get from research agencies and consultancies, in our experience.

There are several core elements

* Close collaboration: an open, timely client dialogue regards the (real) business reason for doing the research or analysis, hypotheses about potential answers and most importantly how the business is likely to act based on potential findings, is critical to delivering results the business will use.  
* Focused study design and insight development: Quality not quantity.  We don't 'boil the ocean', we holistically understand the core questions that the client really cares about, tailoring the research and / or analysis approach accordingly.
* Engaging delivery: Our insights resonate and engage the individuals who need to take action within the client business.  We tailor how we achieve this to a given company's needs and culture e.g. the end deliverable can range from...  a hard-hitting executive summary for the Board, a sales-focused 1-pager for the commercial team, a two-day 'roll up your sleeves' workshop for marketing, a video collage or blog and so on.  The key thing is to have impact, we work with you to make sure this happens.
