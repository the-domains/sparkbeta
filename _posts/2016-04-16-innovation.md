We have an intuitive and rigorous understanding of what is required for innovation success and take accountability not just for measuring how good an idea is, but for helping our clients improve their idea over time.  And whilst a successful end launch makes our spines tingle, we are just as passionate about making sure innovations that are not 'right' or not 'ready' don't go to market.

Whilst we have 'end to end' experience of researching the innovation process, we specialise in:

Opportunity mapping and prioritisation based either on analysis of existing data and/or primary research

Quantitative (with a smidge of qual.) concept / idea testing and refinementOur innovation expertise comes from some of the best in the business -- Cristín has worked extensively on innovation programmes for blue-chip fmcg clients, whilst at Research International and Nielsen BASES.  She has consulted on optimal opportunity spaces to target, helped clients to crack tricky 'white space' markets and provided end to end research support for multi-million Euro product launches.
