We can help you understand all aspects of shopper behaviour, from what prompts people to go shopping in the first place and who does this, to retailer choice, in-store navigation and category interaction, to purchasing influences at the shelf itself.  Answering key questions such as:

* How do shoppers 'see' my category and my brand within this?
* Who am I competing with?
* Which shoppers are most open to my offer?
* Where do they choose to buy my category / brand and why?
* Is my category a 'destination shop' or purchased on impulse?
* How can I influence shopper decision making in my favour?
* Is pre-store more important than in-store?
* Which specific triggers driving purchasing in my category and am I harnessing these effectively?
