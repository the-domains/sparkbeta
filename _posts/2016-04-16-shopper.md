# SHOPPER

We can help you understand all aspects of shopper behaviour, from what prompts people to go shopping in the first place and who does this, to retailer choice, in-store navigation and category interaction, to purchasing influences at the shelf itself.  Answering key questions such as:

* How do shoppers 'see' my category and my brand within this?
* Who am I competing with?
* Which shoppers are most open to my offer?
* Where do they choose to buy my category / brand and why?
* Is my category a 'destination shop' or purchased on impulse?
* How can I influence shopper decision making in my favour?
* Is pre-store more important than in-store?
* Which specific triggers driving purchasing in my category and am I harnessing these effectively?

Crist√≠n has consulted on shopper behaviour, linked to consumer behaviour, over 17 years, at several leading agencies including Kantar Worldpanel, Nielsen and Research International.   She has helped global FMCG and Healthcare manufacturers, as well as Grocery and DIY retailers better engage with their shoppers, to drive stronger category and brand value.
