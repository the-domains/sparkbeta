# Spark Research is a strategic market research consultancy, founded by Cristín Mann in 2014, after 17 years in consumer research and consulting. 

We aim to provide that vital spark of insight that ignites better marketing and commercial decision making in our clients' businesses.  

We work directly with clients from the worlds of manufacturing and retail, providing research design and insight development consulting, as well as running multi-data analysis projects.  We also support research agencies and brand consultancies, providing a highly experienced 'extra pair of hands' as required e.g. for strategic input on ad hoc projects during busy periods, to provide maternity cover and so forth.
